We used to set up table in the garden for breakfast every Saturday, you used to make jalebis for everyone. All the houses we have lived in, this one was my favourite. So happy this picture has survived",

I was really frustrated, my friends had not worked as hard as me, but were now studying in US because they could afford it. I felt that my life would never recover from this. I began playing table tennis for at least two hours everyday. All my frustration came out on the bat, broke many. Now it feels stupid to think that I was so convinced I would never get chance to go out of India just because of that one incident. Should have spent less time on table tennis and more in class.",
